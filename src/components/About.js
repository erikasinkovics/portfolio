               <p>I'm a <strong>junior full-stack developer</strong> based in MontrÃ©al, QuÃ©bec ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦.</p>
               <p>I have changed careers after 8 working years in accounting specialising in process improvement. The search for doing something creative have led me to coding. It combines the fun <strong>problem-solving</strong> aspect of accounting and the joy of <strong>building a concept to reality</strong> that could be useful to others.</p>
               <p>I have recently completed <strong>Le Wagon's full-stack web development bootcamp</strong>. I'm currently learning ReactJS and working on a new Rails project to help my local zero waste community in planning their weekly shopping with the lowest possible carbon footprint.</p>
               <p>Outside of coding, I love hiking with my dog, learning French and exploring new places in QuÃ©bec.
